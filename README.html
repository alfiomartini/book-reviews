<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This is a book review website  where users are able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people.   The application also uses a third-party API by <em>Goodreads</em>, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. The application also supports editing and deleting of user reviews.  Users can also query for book details and book reviews programmatically via the app provided API <code>/api/isbn</code>, which returns a JSON response if the book is found in the database.  The application is developed  with <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>jQuery</em>, <em>Bootstrap</em>, <em>Python</em>,  <em>Flask</em> and the <em>PostgreSQL</em> database. It is my implemenation to one of the several Harvard's CS50Web projects.   You can find it live <a href="https://book-reviews-00.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>
