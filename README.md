# Abstract

This is a book review website  where users are able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people.   The application also uses a third-party API by *Goodreads*, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. The application also supports editing and deleting of user reviews.  Users can also query for book details and book reviews programmatically via the app provided API `/api/isbn`, which returns a JSON response if the book is found in the database.  The application is developed  with _HTML_, _CSS_, _JavaScript_, _jQuery_, _Bootstrap_, _Python_,  _Flask_ and the _PostgreSQL_ database. It is my implemenation to one of the several Harvard's CS50Web projects.   You can find it live [here](https://book-reviews-00.herokuapp.com/).
